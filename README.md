# SmartPark
Intelligent Parking Assistance Software that uses real City of Toronto data, Google GMAPS APIs and Python Geolocation libraries to analyze parking spots in Toronto. 
The software is capable of generating multiple heat maps, reflecting the hourly usage, rates and traffic at each of the 200+ parking spots with available data in Toronto. 
The program also generates a list of recommendations of the "best" parking spots available to the user. The software favours parking spots based on multiple criteria, like physical proximity, price and the amount of vacant space available. 
After the user chooses the parking spot, the software is able to geolocate the user and guide him/her to the chosen parking spot through map generation.
